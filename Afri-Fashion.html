            Organized by the Fowler Museum at UCLA, African-Print Fashion Now! A Story of Taste, Globalization, and Style, introduces audiences to the dynamic traditions of African dress featuring colorful, boldly patterned printed cloth. The exhibition highlights the interplay between regional preferences and cosmopolitanism that has long flourished on the continent, while highlighting the expansiveness of 21st-century African-print fashion.
The works featured throughout the exhibition demonstrate the vital role that African-print has played in the expression of beauty, fashion, and heritage, while creating transcultural connections across Africa and into the larger world.
The exhibition is organized into four distinct sections: “It All Starts with Cloth,” “Portraits in Print,” “Regional
Styles, Fashion Preferences,” and “New Directions.” Collectively, the installation includes sixty tailored fashions, one hundred archival and contemporary cloths, twenty black-and-white studio portrait photographs from the 1960s and 1970s, a series of runway videos, and seven works by contemporary visual artists. Ensembles on view draw from the Fowler’s collections, private loans, and the extensive archives of the Dutch textile
manufacturing company Vlisco.
Several themes weave their way throughout the exhibition, mimicking the cyclical nature of fashion trends and the ripple effects of politics and technology on the formation of identity. One theme is consumer agency, both in determining designs and patterns through purchasing power and by commissioning unique ensembles
from seamstresses and tailors. Another theme is the theatrical power of fashion, and its ability to express individualism or collective solidarity, whether in a family portrait or Women’s Day Marches in communities across the continent. Finally, a link between imaging and fashion surfaces in each section of the exhibition. From formal portraiture to visual arts to ubiquitous African fashion calendars to street style photos shared by cell-phone, it is clear that representations of fashion have always been a nuanced form of communication.
Press Release
African-Print Fashion Now! A Story of Taste, Globalization and Style
March 26–July 30, 2017
Fashion subtly communicates about place, heritage, and belonging through such means as appropriation, pastiche, and revival. Throughout the exhibition, African-print fashions are considered to be creative responses to key historical moments and empowering projections about Africa’s future.

            About the Exhibition
    </h2>
      <p>
            “It All Starts with Cloth” addresses the history of African-print textiles, originally inspired by batik or wax-resist cloth from Indonesia. A dense grid of more than 60 cloths manufactured in Europe, Africa, and Asia evokes the vibrating colors and designs stocked in open-air markets and cloth shops across the African continent. A visual timeline of production across these regions outlines the history of the cloth trade in West and Central Africa from the 1800s to the present. Archival photographs and dramatic film footage of the Vlisco factory in operation transport audiences to the production of cloth in the Netherlands.
            “Portraits in Print” leaves behind the brightly colored world of African-print fashion and enters an intimate
            black-and-white space of memory. A gallery introduces four photographers from Africa’s “golden age” of black-and-white photography in the1960s and 1970s: Francis K. Honny (Ghana, 1914–1998); Jacques Toussele
            (b. Cameroon, 1935); Omar Ly (Senegal, 1943–2016); and Mory Bamba (b. Mali, 1949). Their photography
            studios in newly independent West African countries provided a platform for an ascending middle class to see themselves and be seen by one another. The portraits are indicative of a historical moment when local African-
            print ensemble styles gained new significance as expressions of national and Pan-African pride and identity.
            “Regional Styles, Fashion Preferences,” takes an in-depth look at localized contemporary African-print fashion
            whereby stylish dress is a feature of daily life. Ensembles on view from Cameroon, Côte d’Ivore, Ghana,
            Nigeria, and Senegal reflect an array of styles, all of them customized and individually made to order. This section presents a case study from Kumasi, Ghana to illustrate the interactive commissioning process
            between seamstresses or tailors and their fashion-conscious clientele. The bold patterns of the cloth
            engineered with subtle and striking variations in style reveal the ingenuity and flair of regional designers.

            “New Directions” bridges regional cultures with transnational art and fashion networks, beginning with African-print
styles on global runways in Paris, New York, Dakar, and other cities. Designers in this section include Titi Ademola
(b. London, based in Ghana), Ituen Bassey (b. Nigeria), Afua Dabanka (b. Germany, based in Ghana), Lisa Folawiyo (b. Nigeria), Adama Amanda Ndiaye (b. Democratic Republic of the Congo, based in Senegal), Alexis Temomanin (b. Côte d’Ivoire), Gilles Touré (b. Côte d’Ivoire), and Patricia Waota (b. Côte d’Ivoire). Ensembles on view feature full-length gowns and men’s blazers, metallic wax print and architectural pleating and boning—all of which harmoniously marry the drape of the fabric with the strategic construction of print patterns for stunning results.
Juxtaposed with these glamorous designs are contemporary works by photographers and other visual artists who incorporate print-cloth imagery to convey evocative messages about heritage, hybridity, displacement, and aspiration. Works by photographers Omar Victor Diop (b. Senegal, 1980), Hassan Hajjaj (b. Morocco, 1960),
and Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou (b. Benin, 1965) reveal the complex dialogues about aesthetics, identity, and globalization across history and geography.
“New Directions” also presents contemporary paintings by Njideka Akunyili Crosby (b. Nigeria, 1983) and Eddy Ilunga Kamuanga (b. Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1991), both of whom incorporate images of print cloth in their work. The mural Johannesburg 2081 A.D. from fashion designer Walé Oyéjidé (b. Nigeria, 1981) working
with muralist Lekan Jeyifo (b. Nigeria, 1981) is a futuristic rendering of the cityscape in which self-assured men of the future, stylishly attired in Ikiré Jones African-print jackets, stand before a mural of the South African flag, composed of images of anti-apartheid struggles. Oyéjidé reflects on cloth’s heavy task as a medium but presents his ankara-inspired fashions within a larger-written and imagistic narrative of history, asserting a revolutionary
image of Africa moving forward: “There is elegance; even in the way we carry burdens that would bury most men.”
