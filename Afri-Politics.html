                <h2>'Ghetto President' shakes up Ugandan politics </h2> 
            <img class="image1" src="images/Uganda2.jpg"  height="200px" width="250px">
            NAIROBI(Reuters) - The arrest this month of a 35-year-old legislator who calls himself “Ghetto President” has sparked fierce street protests in Uganda.
            Musician-turned-MP Robert Kyagulanyi represents a new challenge to President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986.
            Museveni has won praise in the West for his support against militant Islam and his role as power broker in the volatile Great Lakes Region.
             <p>
                 Uganda has also welcomed foreign investors such as France’s Total, China’s CNOOC and Britain’s Tullow as part of a plan to start pumping oil from 2021.
            
            But the 74-year-old leader’s move to sign a law scrapping a 75-year age limit has prompted many Ugandans to believe he wants to remain in power indefinitely.
            
            Opposition to him has been galvanized by Kyagulanyi, who according to his backers was beaten and tortured after he was arrested on Aug. 14 for his role in the stoning of Museveni’s convoy.
            
            He was unable to stand without help when he appeared in a military court last week to face charges, subsequently dropped, of illegal weapons possession. He was then charged with treason in a civilian court before being granted bail.
            
            Though many Ugandans have long complained of worsening government services, rising crime and widespread corruption, there has not been a politician broadly popular enough - especially among the young - to challenge the status quo.
           </p>
            
            <h4> WHO IS “BOBI WINE”? </h4>
            <p>
            “Bobi Wine” is the stage name of Kyagulanyi, who entered politics last year with a landslide victory as an independent candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He was already well-known among young Ugandans for his songs about corruption, poor government services and poverty.
            
            “Why de price of electricity too high? Why de price of education is too high?”, Kyagulanyi crooned in one song. His music videos frequently portray the life of everyday Ugandans in neighborhoods with unpaved roads and poor infrastructure.
            
            Kyagulanyi has become a leading critic of unpopular measures including a tax on social media used by many Ugandans. Despite having an active Twitter account himself, Museveni says social media is used to spread gossip and lies.

            </center> 
            
           <h4> HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?</h4> 
            Street protests against government policies have broken out repeatedly in recent years. Rights groups say Museveni has reacted with a mix of force and cash handouts. The government denies the use of heavy-handed tactics and says the country is a thriving multiparty democracy.
            
            Last week, during two days of anti-government demonstrations in the capital Kampala and other parts of the country over Kyagulanyi’s detention, police said they arrested dozens of people in Kampala and fired tear gas to quell “riots”.
            
            On Tuesday, soldiers involved in the alleged beating of Kyagulanyi, four other MPs and civilians who have been charged with treason, the army said. That came after the Parliament Speaker called for the arrest of security forces involved in the beatings in a letter to Museveni on Aug. 27.
            
            <h4>IS HE A THREAT TO MUSEVENI’S GRIP ON POWER? </h4>
            Nearly 80 percent of Uganda’s population of 41 million people is under the age of 30, according to Youth Policy Labs, a Berlin-based think-tank. Though new to politics, Kyagulanyi has succeeded in mobilizing youth discontent. The #FreeBobiWine hashtag has become a rallying point on Twitter.
            
            This is something veteran opposition politicians such as Kizza Besigye, who at 62 years old is considered part of Museveni’s generation, have failed to do so. Besigye has lost three consecutive, disputed presidential elections.
            <p>
            The energy behind Kyagulanyi comes in contrast to signs of declining support for Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter and one of Africa’s longest-serving rulers. At an Independence Day party in his home region last year, uniformed security outnumbered a small crowd of bored spectators.
            
            For now, the protests have abated. But independent Kampala-based analyst Anna Reuss said the movement around Kyagulanyi still had the potential to be a game-changer.
            
            “What has happened over last two weeks has changed the country and changed the conversation,” she said. “It’s lit a fire that even if it just keeps smoldering, the government can’t fully put it out again.”

        <h1> ELECTIONS CAMEROON</h1>
        Cameroon will go to the polls on October 7, 2018, in what is now termed one of the most uncertain and dreaded 
        presidential elections the country has witnessed.

        The decision to organize an election was announced in a press release issued by the incumbent President, 
        Paul Biya, removing all doubts as to whether the violence-gripped nation would make it to the polls.
        <p>
        The 2018 presidential race will take place in a delicate and volatile context, where fear is rife that the 
        nation could slide into a civil war as violence continues in the Southwest and Northwest regions.
        
        The elections governing body, ELECAM, on August 7, 2018 published a list of 9 candidates including, Paul Biya
         who is seeking to extend his 35 years in power.
        
        However, there are doubts that the election will be free and fair, especially in the Anglophone regions which
         have been in turmoil for the past two years, when residents started pressing their claims for more autonomy or
          even independence.
      </p>
      <h4> How Biya finds himself in the 2018 Presidential Race</h4>  
        After being elected five consecutive times for the presidency (in what was a one-party state), Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned in Nov. 6, 1982, and handed power to Paul Biya, who proceeded to oust Ahidjo from chairmanship of the ruling party in 1983.
        
        In 1996, the CPDM oversaw the introduction of a new constitution which limited presidents to two seven-year terms, with Biya’s second term under that constitution to expire in 2011.
        <p>
        However, in 2008, Cameroon’s parliament adopted a constitutional bill, removing the two-term limit to allow President Paul Biya extend his 25-year rule over central Africa’s biggest economy past 2011.
        
        Some provisions of the law N° 96/6 of 18 January 1996 were revised and supplemented to amend the constitution of 2 June 1972, allowing the President of the Republic to be elected for a seven years rule with no term limit.
        
        Since the 2008 constitutional amendment, Biya, 85, has now been in power since 1982, making him one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders.
        
        The shift from a one-party to multi-party system.
     </p>
        <p>
        Under President Ahmadou Ahidjo’s rule, the country was a one-party state, with the Cameroonian National Union being the sole legal party.
        
        Biya introduced political reforms within the context of a one-party system in the 1980s and after serious pressure, he accepted the introduction of multi-party politics in the early 1990s.
        
        The government then adopted a legislation authorizing the formation of multiple political parties. Cameroon’s first multi-party legislative and presidential elections were held in 1992 followed 
        by municipal elections in 1996 and another round of legislative and presidential elections in 1997.
